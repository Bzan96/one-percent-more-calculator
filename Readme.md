# What Is This?

In Tony Robbins book, "Money, Master the Game", he refers to a great calculator that is designed to show the importance
of saving money over time, so called "dollar-cost average investing". The calculator has been instrumental in my own 
changed views on saving money, but sadly the original version runs on Flash, which is a software that is discontinued 
in modern browsers from 2020 - this year. Meaning that unless you use something like Internet Explorer - which you 
don't want to do - you're unable to use the calculator.

## My Solution

I have rewritten the original calculator using modern JavaScript and the data visualization library D3.js. This new 
version does not support Internet Explorer, as it was built as a substitute to the version that does in fact 
work in IE. I have at the same time made some slight improvements to the calculator, such as being able to go up 
to 20% of your salary instead of 16%, as it is often promoted as something to strive towards to invest somewhere 
between 10% and 20% of your salary each month/year.
